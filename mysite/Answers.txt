Question 7
It is a bad idea to hardcode URLs into the templates because this causes tight coupling, so if
you want to change URLs you must change it in multiple places.

Question 8
The benefits of using a generic view is that it lowers the overall code footprint and abstracts
generally reusable views. These views should be used for pages that must perform a common task
that is seen commonly in web apps. As the name states, they are generic, so if you
wish to create a view that does not perform generically it is not a good idea to use
generic views.
